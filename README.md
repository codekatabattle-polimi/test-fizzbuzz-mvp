This is a basic template for katas to be made in Golang.

Students can already fork this repository, but they will be able to submit their commits only once the battle has started.

## Submitting entries for the battle

The GitHub Action provided in this repository will automatically submit the compiled output for execution and test running in an automated way, and does not need modifications.

Since GitHub authorization is required to identify the committer and assign score to battle participant, students need to populate repository secrets with the value GITHUB_PAT, which is a Personal Access Token generated by them for their own GitHub account. The GitHub action to compile and submit artifacts will not run without a value for GITHUB_PAT. The API endpoint will error out for invalid or expired PATs.
